Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation.
It improves factual accuracy by grounding answers in external documents.
RAG works by splitting text into chunks, creating embeddings, and indexing them in a vector store.
During query time, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks and passes them to a language model to generate an answer.
This approach allows small models to perform better by relying on retrieved context.
