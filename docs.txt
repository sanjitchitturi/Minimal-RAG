Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines
retrieval from a knowledge base with a generative model.
FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search on dense vectors.
Sentence Transformers are models that convert text into embeddings.
This project is a minimal demo of RAG for learning purposes.
